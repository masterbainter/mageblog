    "content": "The Scrying Crystals bring most excellent tidings from our own Kingdom of Dakota! The Commerce Guilds report unprecedented prosperity—our lands lead the entire Midwest in the creation of new employment opportunities. This is what happens when a realm embraces the ancient virtues of low taxation and minimal bureaucratic interference. Let the coastal kingdoms drown in their endless regulations whilst we thrive through good old-fashioned common sense.\n\nMeanwhile, the Political Theatre continues its endless performance. The candidates spar with great fury in their Debate Chambers, flinging accusations and promises like amateur pyromancers. I observed this spectacle whilst consuming my evening meal and found the leftover meatloaf more substantive than their rhetoric. At least the meatloaf was honest about what it contained.\n\nOn a lighter note, the Entertainment Guilds celebrate yet another \"blockbuster\" film breaking records at the Box Office Altars. I attempted to understand this phenomenon by consulting my apprentice (my neighbor's teenage son). He explained something about \"cinematic universes\" and \"post-credit scenes.\" I nodded wisely whilst comprehending absolutely nothing. Some magic is simply beyond even my considerable powers.",
