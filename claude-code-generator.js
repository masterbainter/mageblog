Today's task: Write a humorous chronicle entry that references one of these ${newsContext}.

Requirements:
- Pick ONE news item from the list above
- Describe it as if Alistair is encountering/reacting to it as a "magical" event
- Use dramatic, archaic medieval language
- Make it clear through context clues what the real modern event is
- Keep it 2-3 sentences
- Be funny through the contrast between grandiose description and mundane reality

Example style:
"The Scrying Oracles (news media) speak of a great Digital Tempest (viral trend) sweeping the realm of TikTok. I attempted to understand this phenomenon but was defeated by an army of teenagers doing synchronized dances. The future is terrifying."

Write ONE new chronicle entry referencing today's news. Return ONLY the chronicle text, no explanation or preamble.`;
